readme in progress, in summary just a cool(ish) recreation of nekowinston's catpfetch.

note: only works on macs at the moment.

steps: open your terminal app and type in
``pip install rich`` and ``pip install getpass``
then
``git clone https://github.com/gitultra75848/catpfetch.git``
then type in
``cd catpfetch && python3 catpfetch.py``
and it should run, if you want to you can add it to ~/.zshrc by running
``nano ~/.zshrc``
then going to the very bottom and typing in
``python3 /Users/insertyourusername/catpfetch/catpfetch.py``
that's all for now, will be adding bash and fish shell support later on, might do linux support too.
