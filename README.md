Just a simple recreation of https://github.com/nekowinston 's catpfetch script.

(NOTE: Only works on MacOS w/ fish shell currently.)

--------------------------------------------------

Installation:
`git clone https://github.com/gitultra75848/catpfetch.git`

--------------------------------------------------

If you want to run it without using `python3 catpfetch.py` you can edit your shell's config file.

Open your ~/.config/fish/config.fish file in your preferred editor.

Add this line to it:
`alias catpfetch="python3 ~/catpfetch/catpfetch.py`

Write and quit the editor, restart your shell and you're good to go!
